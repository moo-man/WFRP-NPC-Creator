Max: Fellowship Bonus 
Tests: Stealth when in plain sight 

The high and mighty pay no attention to your presence, knowing you are well beneath their notice. Assuming you are properly attired and not in an incongruous position, those of a higher Status Tier will normally ignore you unless your presence becomes inappropriate, which can make it very easy to listen into conversations you perhaps shouldnít. Further, characters with a higher Status Tier than you gain no Advantage for striking or wounding you in combat, as there is nothing to be gained for defeating such a lowly cur.

Tests: Charm to Blather 

Called ëopening your mouth and letting your belly rumbleÅEin Nordland, or simply ëbullshittingÅEin Ostland, blathering involves talking rapidly and incessantly, or talking volubly and at-length, about inconsequential or nonsense matters, and is used to verbally confuse and confound a target. You use your Charm Skill to Blather. Attempt an Opposed Charm/Intelligence Test. Success gives your opponent a Stunned Condition. Further, for each level you have in Blather, your opponent gains another Stunned Condition. Targets Stunned by Blather may do nothing other than stare at you dumbfounded as they try to catch-up with or understand what you are saying. Once the last Stunned Condition comes to an end, the target finally gets a word in, and may not be best pleased with you ÅEafter all, you have been talking about nothing or nonsense for some time. Should you stop talking, your opponent immediately loses all Stunned Conditions caused by your Blather. Generally, you can only attempt to Blather at a character once per scene, or perhaps longer as determined by the GM, as the target soon wises up to your antics.

1 	+2d10 brass pennies 
2 	+1d10 silver shillings

4	+1 gold crown 

Because of your obvious criminal nature, others consider you lower Status than them unless they also have the Criminal Talent, where Status is compared as normal ÅEperhaps you have gang tattoos, look shifty, or are just rough around the edges, itís your choice. Because of this, local law enforcers are always suspicious of you and suspect your motivations, which only gets worse the more times you have this Talent, with the exact implications determined by the GM. Lawbreakers without the Criminal Talent earn significantly less coin but are not obviously the sort to be breaking the law, so maintain their Status. With GM consent, you may spend XP to remove levels of the Criminal Talent for the same XP it cost to buy.

Dual Wielder

9:48 PM

Max: Agility Bonus 
Tests: Melee or Ranged when attacking with two weapons 

When armed with two weapons, you may attack with both for your Action. Roll to hit with the weapon held in your primary hand. If you hit, determine Damage as normal, but remember to keep your dice roll, as you will use it again. If the first strike hits, once it is resolved, the weapon in your secondary hand can then target an available opponent of your choice using the same dice roll for the first strike, but reversed. So, if you rolled 34 to hit with the first weapon, you use 43 to hit with the second. Remember to modify this second roll by your o?-hand penalty (ÅE0 unless you have the Ambidextrous Talent). This second attack is Opposed with a new defending roll, and damage for this second strike is calculated as normal. The only exception to this is if you roll a Critical for your first strike. If this happens, use the roll on the Critical Table to also act as the roll for the second attack. So, if you scored a critical to the head and rolled 56 on the Critical table for a Major Eye Wound, your second attack would then strike out with a to-hit value of 56. If you choose to attack with both weapons, all your defensive rolls until the start of your next Turn su?er a penalty of ÅE0. You do not gain an Advantage when you successfully strike or Wound an opponent when Dual Wielding unless both attacks hit.
