Size (Various)

Thursday, September 13, 2018
12:23 AM

Using Size
if you wish to use size to make a creature bigger — for example converting a giant spider to a gigantic spider — then increase Strength and Toughness by +10 and reduce Agility by –5 per step of size you increase the creature. Reverse this if you wish to make a creature smaller 

This trait represents creatures whose size diﬀer from the game standard (i.e. roughly human sized). There are seven steps of Size, ranging from Tiny to Monstrous. 

Size Combat Modifers
If larger:
	• Its weapons gain the Damaging Quality if the creature is one step larger, and Impact if two steps or more larger.
	• It multiplies any Damage caused by the number of steps larger it is (so, 2 steps=×2, 3 steps =×3, and so on); this multiplication is calculated after all modifiers are applied.
	• All successful strikes against smaller targets activate the Deathblow rule, even if the target survives.
	• For every step larger than Medium, a creature counts as +1 creature for the sake of being outnumbered. 

If smaller:
• It gains a bonus of +10 to hit.

Defending Against Big Creatures
You suﬀer a penalty of –2 SL for each step larger your opponent is when using Melee to defend an Opposed Test. It is recommended to dodge a Giant swinging a tree, not parry it!

Ranged Attacks
You gain a hefty bonus when shooting at larger targets, but for every +10 you receive, you subtract 1 from your damage. (Ex. +40 to hit Enormous, -4 Damage).

Fear and Terror
If the creature is perceived to be aggressive, it causes Fear in any creature smaller than it, and Terror in any creature two or more steps smaller. The rating of the Fear or Terror equals the Size step diﬀerence. So, if the creature is Large, and its opponent is Small, it will cause Terror 2.

Moving in Combat
A creature that is larger ignores the need to Disengage if it wishes to leave melee combat; instead, it brushes smaller combatants out of the way, moving where it wishes. (HR: Probably the other way around as well)

Opposed Strength
During Opposed Strength Tests (and similar), if one creature is 2 or more size steps larger, it wins automatically. If one creature is 1 size step larger, the smaller creature must roll a Critical to contest the roll. If it does, SL are compared as normal. All other results mean the larger creature wins. 

Stomp
Creatures that are larger than their opponents may make one Stomp as a Free Attack, by spending 1 Advantage, as they kick downwards or otherwise bash smaller opponents out of the way. This attack has a Damage equal to their Strength Bonus +0, and uses Melee(Brawling). 

Gaining Advantage (HR)
	• When attacking a larger enemy, you can only gain Advantage from attacking when you crit. Advantage through other means works as normal. Larger creatures only lose 1 Advantage from taking damage, unless it is a critical. 

Size	 Examples
Tiny 	Butterﬂy, Mouse, Pigeon
Little 	Cat, Hawk, Human Baby
Small 	Giant Rat, Halﬂing, Human Child
Average 	Dwarf, Elf, Human
Large 	Horse, Ogre, Troll
Enormous 	Griﬀon, Wyvern, Manticore
Monstrous 	Dragon, Giant, Greater Daemon 

Size 	Wounds
Tiny 	1
Little 	Toughness Bonus
Small	(2×Toughness Bonus) + Willpower Bonus
Average 	Strength Bonus+(2×Toughness Bonus) + Willpower Bonus
Large 	(Strength Bonus+(2×Toughness Bonus) + Willpower Bonus) ×2
Enormous 	(Strength Bonus+(2×Toughness Bonus) + Willpower Bonus) ×4
Monstrous 	(Strength Bonus+(2×Toughness Bonus) + Willpower Bonus) ×8

Thursday, September 13, 2018
12:24 AM

Stupid

Thursday, September 13, 2018
12:24 AM

While not entirely devoid of self-awareness (and so lacking the Bestial trait), the creature is stupid. If it is near any allies without the Stupid Trait, they guide it and nothing happens. Otherwise, it must pass an Easy (+40) Intelligence Test at the start of each round, or become very confused. Should this occur it will drool, perhaps sitting down or picking its nose, doing little of use, losing both its Move and Action for that Turn

12:24 AM

Swarm

Thursday, September 13, 2018
12:24 AM

Swarms are large numbers of the same creature acting as one. The swarm counts as a single Creature that ignores the Psychology rules, and can ignore the Engaged rules when using its Move. If the Swarm successfully strikes an opponent it activates the Deathblow rule (even if it has not killed its opponent). All opponents Engaged with a Swarm automatically lose 1 Wound at the end of every Round as the Swarm overwhelms anything close. The Swarm has five times the Wounds of a normal example of the creature and gains +10 Weapon Skill. Any attempts to shoot the Swarm gain a bonus of +40 to hit. Swarms ignore all the Size

Tail Attack (Rating)

		○ If a tentacle is Grappling, use the tentacle’s Free Attack Action to resolve that Grapple, not the creature’s Action 

Concise

# Tentacles (Rating): 
	• # attacks, Rating damage (SB), causes Entangled if does damage, initiates a Grapple 
	• If a tentacle grapples, the tentacles free attack resolves the Grapple

Unstable

Thursday, September 13, 2018
12:25 AM

The creature’s corpus is maintained by foul magics that are inherently unstable in the material realm. 

Whenever it ends a round engaged with any opponent with higher Advantage, the creature is driven back, and the magics holding it together weaken. It loses as many Wounds as the diﬀerence between its Advantage, and the highest Advantage engaged with it. 

So, if the creature had 1 Advantage, and its opponent had 3, the creature would lose 2 Wounds. If the creature ever reach 0 Wounds, the magics holding it in place collapse, and it ‘dies’.

	• The creature performs an Opposed Ballistic Skill/Dodge Test against all aﬀected targets (its single roll opposed by each individual target). 
		○ The Test is typically Easy (+40) for the vomiting creature, due to the close range, and Challenging (+0) for opponents. 
	• All losing targets suﬀer a hit with a Weapon Damage of the creature’s Toughness Bonus +4 and receive a Stunned condition. 
	• All Armor and Weapons carried by aﬀected targets suﬀer 1 Damage as the acidic vomit corrodes it away. 

Ward (Rating)

Thursday, September 13, 2018
12:25 AM

Perhaps because they are magical, wear a special talisman, or are just plain lucky, some blows just seem to miss. Roll 1d10 after any blow is received, if the creature rolls Rating or higher, the blow is ignored, even if it is a critical.
